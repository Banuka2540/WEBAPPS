        <h3 class="point1">1. Set a Realistic Goal</h3>
        <p id="point1">The first step is to decide how much weight you want to lose. A safe, sustainable weight loss rate is 1-2 pounds per week, which equals about 50-100 pounds over the course of a year. Instead of aiming for drastic changes, focus on steady progress. Losing weight gradually is not only healthier but also helps you maintain your results in the long run.</p>
        <h3 class="point2">2. Calculate Your Calorie Needs</h3>
        <p id="point2">Weight loss fundamentally comes down to burning more calories than you consume. Start by calculating your daily calorie needs based on your age, gender, weight, activity level, and fitness goals. There are various online calculators available to help you find your daily calorie intake for weight loss. Aim to create a calorie deficit by consuming fewer calories than you burn. A typical reduction of 500-1,000 calories per day can help you achieve that 1-2 pounds per week goal.</p>
        <h3 class="point3">3. Focus on Nutrition</h3>
        <p id="point3">What you eat is just as important as how much you eat. Adopting a balanced diet full of nutrient-dense foods will help you feel satisfied while keeping your calorie intake in check.
            <br><br>Here are a few key tips:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Eat more whole foods: Focus on vegetables, fruits, lean proteins, and whole grains. These foods are high in nutrients and low in empty calories.</li>
                <li>Control portion sizes: Even healthy foods can lead to weight gain if you overeat. Keep an eye on portion sizes, especially when dining out.</li>
                <li>Limit processed foods and added sugars: Processed foods are often high in unhealthy fats, sugars, and empty calories. Try to limit sugary drinks, sweets, and fast food.</li>
            </ul>
        <h3 class="point4">4. Stay Hydrated</h3>
        <p id="point4">Drinking enough water is crucial for weight loss. It helps your body function properly and can prevent overeating by keeping you full. Aim to drink at least 8 glasses of water a day, and try to replace sugary drinks with water or herbal tea.</p>
